# Filmic Blender Add-on

All this add-on does is add a button to let you download and install Filmic Blender from [Troy's GitHub](https://github.com/sobotka/filmic-blender) automatically.

If you already have Filmic Blender installed, the button won't even show up. Useful for making sure all workstations in an office environment have it installed :)
