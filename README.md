All this add-on does is add a button to let you download Filmic Blender from [Troy's GitHub](https://github.com/sobotka/filmic-blender) and install it automatically.

If you already have Filmic Blender installed, the button won't even show up. Useful for making sure all workstations in an office environment have it installed :)
